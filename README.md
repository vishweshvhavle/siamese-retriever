# Siamese Retriever
Image retrieval is the process of searching for and retrieving images from a database or repository based on a query which is usually an image itself. It remains interesting problem in the domains of Information Retrieval and Computer Vision. This is the official repository for our Content-Based Image Retrieval system which uses a Siamese-ConvNet architecture backbone written in PyTorch.

# Pre-Trained Model
The computational resources consist of 1 Intel ® Core i7-10700, 16GB of RAM, 1 GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti with 4GB of memory. The model is fine-tuned over ResNet-18 for our dataset [IF300](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jhz6b7qxxMoeIHuZnpkc84WNMp2tYqXI/view?usp=share_link) and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A_hDAADDoxe1mjJ4lxuYgCnHk3j06aar/view?usp=share_link).
