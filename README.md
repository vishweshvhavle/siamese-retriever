# Siamese Retriever
Image retrieval is the process of searching for and retrieving images from a database or repository based on a query which is usually an image itself. It remains interesting problem in the domains of Information Retrieval and Computer Vision. This is the official repository for our Content-Based Image Retrieval system which uses a Siamese-ConvNet architecture backbone written in PyTorch.

# Pre-Trained Model
The computational resources consist of 1 Intel Â® Core i7-10700, 16GB of RAM, 1 GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti with 4GB of memory. The model was trained on our architecture for our dataset [IF20K](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GGyYYRRznMQ9XllWJyXFNtoDh4vK99kU?usp=share_link) and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZpAX8WalKw44wuNPF53sxGwQxgTuySAw/view?usp=share_link). 

# How To Run
Download the dataset and the pre-trained model.

Clone the repository and run the following commands to get the app running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```
